## 🧱 MVP Feature Breakdown: Spellweaver’s Grimoire

### 1. **Spell Path Selector**

**What it does:**

Lets users pick one of several “spellcrafting” paths, each representing a prompt engineering exercise (e.g., Thoughtcraft, Structured Intent, Prompt Tinkering, Persona Craft).

**UI Element:**

A scroll or list of spell cards, each with:

- Title
- Description
- Emoji/icon (🧠 ✨ 🧪 🎭)
- “Begin” button

**Backend/API:**

None required — just triggers a UI state change to load the appropriate exercise component.

### 2. **Prompt Crafting Arena**

**What it does:**

The central playground where users write or edit prompts, view instructions, and see AI-generated results.

**UI Element:**

- A prompt input field (textarea or markdown editor)
- An explanation box (instructions or spell description)
- A “Cast Spell” button (executes the prompt)
- An output display panel for model responses

**Backend/API:**

- Calls the OpenAI or Ollama API (or other LLM endpoint)
- Sends user prompt
- Receives and displays model response

---

### 3. **Spell Feedback Box**

**What it does:**

After the model responds, the Spellweaver (you or BittyGPT) gives feedback on how strong the “spell” was. Optionally includes pros/cons, scores, or tips.

**UI Element:**

- Feedback box under the response
- Textual tips like: ✅ “Clear directive” ❌ “No role or context”
- Optional “Try Again” button

**Backend/API:**

- Could use a system message to simulate BittyGPT giving feedback
- For now, we can hardcode or use a template (no AI feedback engine yet unless easy)

### 4. **Grimoire Entry Display (Static)**

**What it does:**

Shows a prewritten “lore” card for the selected spell path. Describes the technique being practiced (e.g., Chain of Thought), with a bit of story flavor.

**UI Element:**

- Scroll-style card with spell name
- Short story-flavored description
- Optional example prompt + output

**Backend/API:**

- None; pulled from a local JSON or markdown file for now

---

### 5. **Magic Scoreboard (Optional if we have time)**

**What it does:**

Tracks how many spells you’ve tried and how many were “strong” (i.e., scored well). Adds gamification.

**UI Element:**

- Small UI in the corner
- XP points or badges for completing prompts
- “Spellbook filled: 3/8 spells cast!”

**Backend/API:**

- Can be local storage or simple counter for MVP
- Could expand to use user accounts later

---

### 6. **Minimal Navigation / UI**

**What it does:**

Basic page structure with:

- Logo/Title: *The Promptweaver’s Grimoire*
- Home / Restart button
- Optional About modal

**Frontend:**

React + Tailwind for layout

Shadcn/ui or Lucide for basic components/icons
