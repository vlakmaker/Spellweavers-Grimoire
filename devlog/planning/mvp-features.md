### **Promptweaver’s Grimoire: MVP Overview**

**Core Concept:**

An interactive, magical-themed web playground where users learn prompt engineering by casting "spells" — each spell is a type of prompt technique. Users practice, get feedback (from an AI or template), and gradually unlock new techniques.

### **1. User Journey**

**Step 1: Choose a Spell Type (aka Prompting Technique)**

User is presented with 4–5 magical categories, each corresponding to a prompt engineering category:

- **Thoughtcraft** (e.g., Chain-of-Thought)
- **Structured Intent** (e.g., full prompt design)
- **Tinkering** (e.g., prompt optimization)
- **Persona Craft** (e.g., role shaping)
- **Spell Trials** (optional challenges or mini-games)

**Step 2: Prompt Practice**

Users are asked to *create* or *refine* a prompt based on the technique selected.

Example:

> "Craft a Chain-of-Thought spell to help an AI solve a riddle."
> 

They type in their prompt inside a live editor.

**Step 3: Spell Evaluation**

After submitting:

- BittyGPT reviews the prompt using a checklist (was there a clear role, directive, examples, etc.)
- Visual markers (checkmarks/crosses or stars) provide feedback on strengths & areas to improve.
- Optional: A model responds to the user’s prompt so they can see its effectiveness.

**Step 4: Learning Notes**

Bitty gives:

- A score or level-up badge
- Friendly, magical commentary
- Suggestions to improve
- Option to view model answer

### **2. Interface Ideas**

- **Grimoire Sidebar:** Shows categories, unlocked spells, and your current “Apprentice Rank”
- **Live Spell Editor:** A textbox for writing prompts, with real-time validation hints
- **Feedback Panel:** Animated responses from Bitty (text-based for MVP), plus scoring
- **Spell History Log:** Lets users see previous spells and their evolution

### **3. Technology (for MVP)**

- Frontend: React or Next.js with Tailwind for clean magical UI
- Backend: Simple API using OpenAI, Claude, or Mistral via serverless functions
- Evaluation Logic: Either a rules-based checklist or AI-assistant (Bitty) with a scoring rubric
- Storage: LocalStorage or Firebase for saving spell history
